# Search Users Test App
A simple application with a single-page interface that allows users to search for data stored in a JSON file. The app presents a form with email (required) and number (optional) fields, along with a submit button. Upon submission, the app sends a query to the backend to find matching user data and displays the results below the form.

## Features
```User-friendly form with email and optional number field
Backend introduces a 5-second processing delay
Validation for email and optional number field
Frontend number field with hyphenated mask (e.g., 22-11-22, 83-03-47)
